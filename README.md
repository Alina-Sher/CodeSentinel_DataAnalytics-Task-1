# 📊 CodeSentinel_DataAnalytics-Task1

## 🧠 Task Overview
I developed a Python-based dataset exploration script to efficiently load, inspect, and summarize structured data (e.g., Iris dataset in CSV format). The script provides quick insights into dataset structure, column metadata, row counts, and statistical distributions—helping data analysts, students, and professionals understand their data before applying deeper analytics or machine learning techniques.
This script serves as a foundation for data analysis pipelines, ensuring data is validated, clean, and well-understood before advanced modeling.

## 📊 Key Outputs Generated

- **Column Names** → Displays all feature/column names in the dataset.
- **Number of Rows** → Provides dataset size and total entries for initial checks.
- **Summary Statistics** → Generates descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for numerical columns.
- **Data Types & Structure** → Identifies numeric vs categorical features and highlights potential preprocessing needs.

## 📈 Visual Insights & Components (Console-Based):

### ✅ Dataset Info
Prints number of rows, columns, and non-null counts.

### 📊 Column Metadata
Outputs list of feature names to quickly verify dataset schema.

### 📌 Summary Statistics
Provides measures of central tendency (mean, median), spread (std, min, max), and distribution (quartiles).

### 🧑‍💻 Quick Preview
Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset for rapid inspection.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook / Script)** → Core language for data loading and processing.
- **Pandas** → DataFrame creation, summary statistics, and structural overview.
